# CPSLP-Speech_synthesis
# Project Overview

This project is a small diphone-based speech synthesis program implemented in Python. It converts either a single input phrase or the contents of a text file into a waveform by concatenating pre-recorded diphone WAV units.

The synthesiser supports basic audio post-processing (volume scaling and multiple reverse modes) and can optionally smooth unit boundaries using cross-fade. The generated audio can be played directly or saved to a WAV file.

## Features

- **Phrase synthesis**  
  Generate speech from a single input phrase provided directly on the command line.

- **File-based synthesis (`--fromfile`)**  
  Read a text file, split it into sentences, and synthesise each sentence sequentially.

- **Diphone concatenation**  
  Speech is generated by concatenating diphone WAV units stored in a user-specified directory.

- **Cross-fade smoothing (`--crossfade`)**  
  Optionally apply a short cross-fade between adjacent diphones to reduce audible discontinuities.

- **Audio playback (`--play`)**  
  Play the synthesised audio directly after generation.

- **WAV output (`--outfile`)**  
  Save the generated speech to a WAV file.

- **Volume control (`--volume`)**  
  Scale the output volume using a percentage value between 0 and 100.

- **Reverse modes (`--reverse`)**  
  - `words`: reverse the order of words before synthesis  
  - `phones`: reverse the phoneme sequence  
  - `signal`: reverse the final audio signal

- **Custom pronunciation dictionary (`--addpron`)**  
  Extend or override the default CMU pronunciation dictionary with user-defined entries.

```
- `synth.py` contains the core synthesis logic, including text processing, phoneme lookup, diphone concatenation, and audio post-processing.

- `synth_args.py` defines the command-line interface and enforces usage constraints, such as requiring either a phrase or `--fromfile` (but not both).

- `simpleaudio.py` provides a lightweight wrapper for audio loading, playback, and WAV file handling.

- The diphone WAV directory must be supplied by the user and is not generated by this project.
